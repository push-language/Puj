(defn simple-instruction
  "Creates an instruction which uses a standardized way of manipulating Push states.

  Simple instructions handle popping their own function arguments and pushing the return values.

  The first step of evaluating a simple instruction is to pop the arguments from the stacks corresponding
  to the instruction's `input-stacks`. If multiple occurrences of the same type are in `input-stacks`,
  items are taken from progressively deeper in that stack. If the stacks of the  Push state do not contain
  a sufficient number of items, the instruction does not modify the Push state.

  The popped arguments are then passed to the instruction's `logic` function to produce the return value(s).
  The return value(s) are then routed to the corresponding stacks specified in the instruction's `output-stacks`"
