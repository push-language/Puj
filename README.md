# Puj

PushGP framework in Clojure.

> WARNING: This project is massively incomplete and should not be used at this time. 
This repository is public to facilitate discussion and development amongst the many 
researchers and practitioners of the Genetic Programming community.

## Rationale

@TODO: Distill the overall design goals described by the design doc.

## Usage

Puj is not publicly available at this time, aside from the source code. Hopefully soon
there will be the first [Clojars](https://clojars.org/) release along with 
[cljdoc](https://cljdoc.org/) documentation.

In the meantime, we welcome any and all contributions. To learn more about how to 
be most helpful, see our the CONTRIBUTING file.

## Tests

To run test, run the following command in the project root.

```commandline
clojure -A:test
```
