# Contributing

Contributions to Puj are welcome and encouraged! 

## Contribution Types

### Reporting Bugs and Feature Requests

Reporting bugs and requesting features should be done by opening issues on the [Puj GitHub repository](https://github.com/push-language/Puj/issues) page.

### Contributing Documentation 

Suggestions for changes to documentation articles or docstrings can be made with a simple [pull request](https://github.com/push-language/Puj/pulls)
which will be reviewed by one of the project's core maintainers. 

### Contributing Bug Fixes and Code Cleanup

If the bug is small and the fix seems obvious, code can be contributed via a [pull request](https://github.com/push-language/Puj/pulls).

For larger bugs or fixes that might require more careful consideration, it might be more efficient to 
[open an issue](https://github.com/push-language/Puj/issues) first to allow the entire community to comment 
before time is spent on code.

### Contributing New Features

Contributions which add new features or result in large changes to the codebase should be discussed by the community
[in an issue](https://github.com/push-language/Puj/issues) before being implemented. Once an issue has been fully
discussed it will be considered ready for a [pull request](https://github.com/push-language/Puj/pulls).

## Workflow for contributions

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (aka topic branch) for your changes.
3. Add your code changes.
    - Be sure to add adequate tests and documentation for your change, if applicable.
    - Contributions which use a sane code style will be appreciated. :)
4. Ensure all tests are passing.
5. Push your code to your fork of the repository.
6. Make a Pull Request to `master` with a description.
    - If there is a corresponding Issue, remember to link it.
    - Feel free to request a review if you think you know any users who will have valuable input.
7. Wait for one or more of the project collaborators to review the Pull Request.

You may be asked to rebase/squash your branch into a single commit before merging in order to avoid having any commits on `master` 
which would be considered broken.
